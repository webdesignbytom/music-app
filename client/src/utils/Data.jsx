    title: 'About',
    note: <BsMusicNote size={25} />,
    content: `Stuart Turnbull (b. 1975) is an award-winning British composer, pianist, and conductor. He was raised in a musical family, and after schooling in the south of the UK, he studied Piano Performance at the Royal Conservatoire of Birmingham, graduating with a First Class degree. He was influenced there by the ground-breaking Indian Classical musician, John Mayer, who inspired him with a fascination with rhythm in particular. He continued his studies in composition at the Royal College of Music in London under Julian Anderson and Sir George Benjamin. He is currently pursuing a doctorate in composition.`,
  },
  {
    title: 'Career',
    note: <BsMusicNoteBeamed size={25} />,
    content: `Stuart has taught music at the undergraduate level for many years, and his music is frequently performed, recorded, and broadcast across the UK and further afield. He has been composer-in-residence with a number of UK-based arts organisations and festivals. He specialises in writing choral, orchestral, and chamber music, and his music has been recorded and broadcast by professional ensembles, including the Choir of Selwyn College, Cambridge, Blossom Street, the BBC Singers, the Chamber Choir of Europe, and Siglo D’Oro choir, many UK cathedrals, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, Kansas City Symphony, London Philharmonic and English Chamber Orchestra (London).`,

  {
    title: 'Personality',
    note: <HiOutlineMusicNote size={25} />,
    content: `Harmonically, Stuart’s music is colourful and imaginative, while always adhering to technically rigorous contrapuntal lines. Recent reviews regularly feature the words captivating, imaginative, refreshing, energetic, and fearless. Of his orchestral work ‘Odyssey’, Stuart says “this work reflects a time in my life when things were changing: I remember the uncertainty, but also the excitement. The music mirrors this: it’s impetuous, twisting and turning, and not staying still. Each new idea runs (often at speed) into the next, without conclusion: another shift, another new direction, another new idea.”`,
